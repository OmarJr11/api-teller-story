_Available Scripts_

`npm run dev` allows you to run the server in port 8000 or the port set in the .env variable.
It transpiles the typescript code into javascript and starts the server.

`npm start` allows you to run the server with a standard node call (you have to transpile the typescript code first)

`npm tsc` allows you to acces all the _tsc_ commands.
